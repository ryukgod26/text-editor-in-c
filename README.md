## Project Overview

This project is a simple text editor implemented in C. It aims to provide a lightweight and efficient text editing experience directly from the command line. The value proposition is to offer a minimal, dependency-free alternative to heavier GUI-based text editors, particularly useful in resource-constrained environments or when quick text manipulation is needed. The editor solves the problem of needing to edit text files without relying on complex software or graphical interfaces.

## Key Features

*   **Lightweight and Fast:** Written in C for optimal performance and minimal resource usage.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Operates directly in the terminal, providing a familiar interface for developers and system administrators.
*   **Basic Text Editing:** Supports fundamental operations like inserting, deleting, and navigating text.
*   **File Handling:** Allows opening, saving, and creating text files.
*   **Customizable:** Offers configuration options for key bindings and editor behavior.

## Visual Demo

> *[Placeholder: Insert screenshots or a GIF demonstrating the text editor in action. Focus on showcasing key features and the user interface.]*

## Prerequisites

Before installing and using the text editor, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

*   **C Compiler:** GCC (version 7.0 or later) or any other compatible C compiler.

    bash
    make --version
        > *[Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project repository.]*

2.  **Compile the source code:**

    bash
    gcc -o text_editor main.c editor.c file_operations.c utils.c -Wall -Wextra
    ## Configuration

The text editor can be configured through a configuration file (e.g., `.texteditorrc`) located in the user's home directory. The following options are available:

*   **Key Bindings:** Customize key bindings for different actions.
*   **Editor Settings:** Configure settings like tab size, indentation style, and syntax highlighting (if supported).

Example configuration file:

bash
./text_editor <filename>
> *[Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to edit. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.]*

Basic editing commands:

*   **Movement:** Use arrow keys to move the cursor.
*   **Insertion:** Type to insert text at the cursor position.
*   **Deletion:** Use `Backspace` and `Delete` keys to remove characters.
*   **Saving:** Press `Ctrl+S` (or the configured key binding) to save the file.
*   **Exiting:** Press `Ctrl+Q` (or the configured key binding) to exit the editor.

### Advanced Usage

*   **Search and Replace:** Use `Ctrl+F` to search for text and `Ctrl+H` to replace text.
*   **Line Numbering:** Toggle line numbering display with `Ctrl+L`.
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** If supported, the editor will automatically highlight code based on the file extension.

## API Documentation

### `editor.c`

#### `void init_editor()`

Initializes the editor state.

*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Returns:** None
*   **Example:**

c
    #include "editor.h"

    int main() {
        init_editor();
        process_keypress();
        // ...
        return 0;
    }
    #### `int open_file(const char *filename)`

Opens a file for editing.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   `filename`: The name of the file to open.
*   **Returns:** `0` on success, `-1` on failure.
*   **Example:**

> *[Provide detailed documentation for all public functions, including parameters, return values, and usage examples. Use a consistent format for each function.]*

## Troubleshooting

*   **Problem:** Editor crashes when opening a large file.
    *   **Solution:** Increase the buffer size in `editor.h` or implement dynamic memory allocation.
*   **Problem:** Key bindings are not working as expected.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the configuration file syntax and ensure the correct key codes are being used.
*   **Problem:** Compilation fails due to missing headers.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all required dependencies are installed and the include paths are correctly configured.

## Performance Considerations

*   **Memory Usage:** The editor is designed to be lightweight, but large files can still consume significant memory. Consider implementing paging or lazy loading for very large files.
*   **Rendering:** Optimize the rendering loop to minimize screen updates and reduce CPU usage.
*   **File I/O:** Use buffered I/O to improve file reading and writing performance.

## Security Notes

*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to prevent buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities.
*   **File Permissions:** Ensure proper file permissions are set to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **External Libraries:** Avoid using external libraries with known security vulnerabilities.

## Roadmap

*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Implement syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
*   **Search and Replace:** Add advanced search and replace functionality with regular expression support.
*   **Undo/Redo:** Implement undo and redo functionality for editing operations.
*   **Multi-File Support:** Allow opening and editing multiple files simultaneously.
*   **Plugin Support:** Add support for plugins to extend the editor's functionality.
